Never denied a thing, he had the world at his fingertips, yet his heart constantly reminded him that there were more important things in life than wealth and privilege. But with people using him as a means to better their own lives, he had little chance to explore the desire of his own heart. Suspicious of anyone who ever tried to get close, Tin had closed his heart off to the world, until the day he met Can. 
An innocent and rather impressionable young man, Can had never met anyone quite like Tin. An incorruptible soul, Can’s sweetness left an indelible impression on Tin and their friendship blossomed overnight. However, as Tin and Can drew closer, Tin began to realize his feelings for his friend were quickly becoming much stronger than those of simple friendship. Mustering the courage to tell Can how he felt, Tin admitted his feelings for his friend, but Can could not accept them.
Heartbroken, Tin must now decide where things go from here. Does he give up on the boy who stole his heart? Or does he hold onto the hope that eventually, true love will conquer all?`

Comparing their sons' achievements and merits, whether it be academic or extracurricular — the two fathers left no stones unturned to outshine and gloat in front of the other.

It was almost like rivalry was passed down as a family heirloom and the two boys became rivals as well. Until... they grew tired and became friends. Really good friends.

However, because of their fathers' rivalry, their friendship had to be kept under wraps. And so began a journey of secret friendship... and then perhaps a sweet secret romance?`

Intouch entered Korn's life despite knowing that he was the son of one of the most influential people in Bangkok, the mafia. At first, Korn kept pushing Intouch away, but in the end, he couldn't resist the boy who was so full of life where he was the exact opposite and decided to let him into his heart. 
However, in a time where homosexuality was unacceptable and having parents that were against their relationship and each other, Korn and In's love was bound to be doomed. Midst the chaos, while Intouch kept on fighting for their future, Korn could not deal with all the suffering his lover was facing and decided to give up. That day, two sounds of a gunshot rang through the air. 
Their story ended with tragedy, but something had already tied itself between them, bounding them together even after they were dead. 
Years later, a freshly returned to Thailand, Pharm (19) who is a  freshman in T- University has grown up always feeling like he is waiting for someone. Being riddled with sad dreams that always left him waking up with a wet face, fear of loud noises, and a birthmark on his temple, the boy has always felt like there is someone he is missing. Dean (21), the third year swimming club's president at T- University has also spent his life searching for someone whose faces he can not remember. The red thread of fate that had tied them together in their past life once again pulls the two boys back to each other, tieing them to each other and a past that might not be worth remembering, but a love that is unforgettable. Because the red thread that binds the two hearts together will always lead one back to the other. Even though it might tangle or stretch, but it will never break. `

To make matters worse, Khai has a "no dating friends" policy. How long can Third love Khai silently while watching Khai bring a different girl home every night? Third has tried to see Khai as just a friend. But has failed time and time again. Because as easy as it is to fall in love, to stop is just as hard.  Maybe even harder.

One day, seemingly from nowhere, White feels an agony like death. He recovers in the hospital, but they’re unable to determine the cause. Then he picks up a call from a childhood friend, Todd. Todd tells him that Black is in a coma following a vicious attack and he learns that Black is in a motorcycle gang. Unable to endure the harm done to his brother in silence, and suspecting it was one of Black’s close friends—Sean, Gram, or Yok—who betrayed him, White disguises himself as Black to root out the traitor.

But White doesn’t know his brother as well as he thought; he’s not behaving like the Black Sean knows, distrustful and uncaring about the feelings of others. Sean's suspicious. The difference gets under Sean's skin and makes him feel things he shouldn’t.`
